# Ninjacart-CV-Classification

Ninjacart is India's largest fresh produce supply chain company. 

**Problem Statement**

They are pioneers in solving one of the toughest supply chain problems of the world by leveraging innovative technology. They source fresh produce from farmers and deliver them to businesses within 12 hours. An integral component of their automation process is the development of robust classifiers which can distinguish between images of different types of vegetables, while also correctly labeling images that do not contain any one type of vegetable as noise.

As a starting point, ninjacart has provided us with a dataset scraped from the web which contains train and test folders, each having 4 sub-folders with images of onions, potatoes, tomatoes and some market scenes. We have been tasked with preparing a multiclass classifier for identifying these vegetables. The dataset provided has all the required images to achieve the task.
